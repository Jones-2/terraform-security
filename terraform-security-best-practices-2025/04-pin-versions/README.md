# Pin Module & Provider Versions

This folder shows required_version and required_providers pinned examples for each cloud.

Why pin?
- Prevent breaking changes
- Avoid unintentionally pulling malicious or untested versions

Keep a policy or internal process for updating pinned versions regularly and testing changes in a staging environment.
